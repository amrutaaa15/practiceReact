        <div>
            <p>

                jQuery is a lightweight, "write less, do more", JavaScript library. The purpose of jQuery is to make it
                much easier to use JavaScript on your website. jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many
                lines of JavaScript code to accomplish, and wraps them into methods that you can call with a single line
                of code.

        <h3>What is Accordian</h3>
        <div>
            <p>
                jQuery UI Accordian is an expandable and collapsible content holder that is broken into sections and
                probably looks like tabs. Syntax: You can use the accordion () method in two forms: $(selector,
                context).
            </p>
        </div>
        <h3>Where is it autocomplete?</h3>
        <div>
            <p>
                In the process of searching a specific value, the jQuery UI autocomplete selection feature provides the
                user with some string suggestions for the input area which effectively saves time. The autocomplete
                select action is triggered when the user selects one of the options from the pre-populated list
