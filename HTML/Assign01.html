                    React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library[3]
                    for building user interfaces or UI components. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of
                    individual developers and companies.[4][5][6] React can be used as a base in the development of
                    single-page or mobile applications. However, React is only concerned with state management and
                    rendering that state to the DOM, so creating React applications usually requires the use of
                    additional libraries for routing, as well as certain client-side functionality.[7]Another notable
                    feature is the use of a virtual Document Object Model, or virtual DOM. React creates an in-memory
                    data-structure cache, computes the resulting differences, and then updates the browser's displayed
                    DOM efficiently.[9] This process is called reconciliation. This allows the programmer to write code
                    as if the entire page is rendered on each change, while the React libraries only render
                    subcomponents that actually change. This selective rendering provides a major performance
                    boost.[citation needed] It saves the effort of recalculating the CSS style, layout for the page and
                    rendering for the entire page.[citation needed]Lifecycle methods use a form of hooking that allows
                    the execution of code at set points during a component's lifetime.
                    shouldCmponentUpdate allows the developer to prevent unnecessary re-rendering of a component by
                    returning false if a render is not required.
                    componentDidMount is called once the component has "mounted" (the component has been created in the
                    user interface, often by associating it with a DOM node). This is commonly used to trigger data
                    loading from a remote source via an API.
                    componentWillUnmount is called immediately before the component is torn down or "unmounted". This is
                    commonly used to clear resource-demanding dependencies to the component that will not simply be
                    removed with the unmounting of the component (e.g., removing any setInterval() instances that are
                    related to the component, or an "eventListener" set on the "document" because of the presence of the
                    component)

                    componentDidMount is called once the component has "mounted" (the component has been created in the

                    for building user interfaces or UI components. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of
                    individual developers and companies.[4][5][6] React can be used as a base in the development of
                    single-page or mobile applications. However, React is only concerned with state management and
                    rendering that state to the DOM, so creating React applications usually requires the use of
                    additional libraries for routing, as well as certain client-side functionality.[7]Another notable
                    feature is the use of a virtual Document Object Model, or virtual DOM. React creates an in-memory

                    DOM efficiently.[9] This process is called reconciliation. This allows the programmer to write code
                    as if the entire page is rendered on each change, while the React libraries only render
