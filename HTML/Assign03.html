            <h1>#Coronavirus</h1>
            <p>
                Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.

                Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and
                recover without requiring special treatment. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems
                like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to
                develop serious illness.
            </p>
            <p>
                The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the
                disease it causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands
                or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face.

                The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an
                infected person coughs or sneezes, so it’s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for
                example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).
            </p>
            <p>
                At this time, there are no specific vaccines or treatments for COVID-19. However, there are many ongoing
                clinical trials evaluating potential treatments. WHO will continue to provide updated information as
                soon as clinical findings become available.

            <h2>FAQ-Frequently Askend questions</h2>
            <p>Q. What Is A Coronavirus?</p>
            <p>Ans.Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans. In humans,
                several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more
                severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
                (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>Q.What Is COVID-19?</p>
            <p>Ans.COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus
                and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>Q.What Are The Symptoms Of COVID-19?</p>
            <p>Ans.The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have
                aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild
                and begin gradually. Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell.
                Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of
                every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people,
                and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are
                more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek
                medical attention.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>Q.How Does COVID-19 Spread?</p>
            <p>Ans.People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to
                person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs
                or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch
                COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also
                catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales
                droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.
                WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share updated
                findings.</p>
            <hr>

            <p>Q.Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?</p>
            <p>Ans.Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact
                with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.</p>
            <hr>

            <p>Q.Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?</p>
            <p>Ans.The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing.
                The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. However, many people
                with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the
                disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough
                and does not feel ill. WHO is assessing ongoing research on the period of transmission of COVID-19 and
                will continue to share updated findings.</p>
            <hr>

            <p>Q.Can I catch COVID-19 from the feces of someone with the disease?</p>
            <p>Ans.The risk of catching COVID-19 from the feces of an infected person appears to be low. While initial
                investigations suggest the virus may be present in feces in some cases, spread through this route is not
                a main feature of the outbreak. WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and
                will continue to share new findings. Because this is a risk, however, it is another reason to clean
                hands regularly, after using the bathroom and before eating.</p>
            <hr>

            <p>Q.Should I worry about COVID-19?</p>
            <p>Ans.Illness due to COVID-19 infection is generally mild, especially for children and young adults.
                However, it can cause serious illness: about 1 in every 5 people who catch it need hospital care. It is
                therefore quite normal for people to worry about how the COVID-19 outbreak will affect them and their
                loved ones. We can channel our concerns into actions to protect ourselves, our loved ones and our
                communities. First and foremost among these actions is regular and thorough hand-washing and good
                respiratory hygiene. Secondly, keep informed and follow the advice of the local health authorities
                including any restrictions put in place on travel, movement and gatherings.</p>
            <hr>

            <p>Q.Who is at risk of developing severe illness?</p>
            <p>Ans.While we are still learning about how COVID-2019 affects people, older persons and persons with
                pre-existing medical conditions (such as high blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease, cancer or
                diabetes) appear to develop serious illness more often than others.</p>
            <hr>

            <p>Q.Are there any medicines or therapies that can prevent or cure COVID-19?</p>
            <p>Ans.While some western, traditional or home remedies may provide comfort and alleviate symptoms of
                COVID-19, there is no evidence that current medicine can prevent or cure the disease. WHO does not
                recommend self-medication with any medicines, including antibiotics, as a prevention or cure for
                COVID-19. However, there are several ongoing clinical trials that include both western and traditional
                medicines. WHO will continue to provide updated information as soon as clinical findings are available.
