        <h1>Angular</h1>
        Angular (commonly referred to as "Angular 2+" or "Angular v2 and above")[4][5] is a TypeScript-based free and open-source web application framework led by the Angular Team at Google and by a community of individuals and corporations. Angular is a complete rewrite from the same team that built AngularJS.

Angular is used as the frontend of the MEAN stack, consisting of MongoDB database, Express.js web application server framework, Angular itself (or AngularJS), and Node.js server runtime environment.Naming
Originally, the rewrite of AngularJS was called "Angular 2", but this led to confusion among developers. To clarify, the Team announced that separate terms should be used for each framework with "AngularJS" referring to the 1.X versions and "Angular" without the "JS" referring to versions 2 and up.[8]

Version 2
Angular 2.0 was announced at the ng-Europe conference 22–23. October 2014.[9][10] The drastic changes in the 2.0 version created considerable controversy among developers.[11] On April 30, 2015, the Angular developers announced that Angular 2 moved from Alpha to Developer Preview.[12] Angular 2 moved to Beta in December 2015,[13] and the first release candidate was published in May 2016.[14] The final version was released on September 14, 2016.

Version 4
On 13 December 2016 Angular 4 was announced, skipping 3 to avoid a confusion due to the misalignment of the router package's version which was already distributed as v3.3.0.[15] The final version was released on March 23, 2017.[16] Angular 4 is backward compatible with Angular 2.[17]

Angular version 4.3 is a minor release, meaning that it contains no breaking changes and that it is a drop-in replacement for 4.x.x.

Features in version 4.3

Introducing HttpClient, a smaller, easier to use, and more powerful library for making HTTP Requests.
New router life cycle events for Guards and Resolvers. Four new events: GuardsCheckStart, GuardsCheckEnd, ResolveStart, ResolveEnd join the existing set of life cycle event such as NavigationStart.
Conditionally disable animations.
Version 5
Angular 5 was released on November 1, 2017.[18] Key improvements in Angular 5 include support for progressive web apps, a build optimizer and improvements related to Material Design.[19]

Version 6
Angular 6 was released on May 4, 2018.[20] This is a major release focused less on the underlying framework and more on the toolchain and on making it easier to move quickly with Angular in the future, like: ng update, ng add, Angular Elements, Angular Material + CDK Components, Angular Material Starter Components, CLI Workspaces, Library Support, Tree Shakable Providers, Animations Performance Improvements, and RxJS v6.

Version 7
Angular 7 was released on October 18, 2018. Updates regarding Application Performance, Angular Material & CDK, Virtual Scrolling, Improved Accessibility of Selects, now supports Content Projection using web standard for custom elements, and dependency updates regarding Typescript 3.1, RxJS 6.3, Node 10 (still supporting Node 8).[21]

Version 8
Angular 8 was released on May 28, 2019. Featuring Differential loading for all application code, Dynamic imports for lazy routes, Web workers, TypeScript 3.4 support, and Angular Ivy as an opt-in preview. Angular Ivy opt-in preview includes:[22]

Generated code that is easier to read and debug at runtime
Faster re-build time
Improved payload size
Improved template type checking
Backwards compatibility
Version 9
Angular 9 was released on February 6, 2020. Version 9 moves all applications to use the Ivy compiler and runtime by default. Angular has been updated to work with TypeScript 3.6 and 3.7. In addition to hundreds of bug fixes, the Ivy compiler and runtime offers numerous advantages:

Smaller bundle sizes
Faster testing
Better debugging
Improved CSS class and style binding
Improved type checking
Improved build errors
Improved build times, enabling AOT on by default
Improved Internationalization

    <div id="react">

        <h1>React</h1>
        React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library[3] for building user interfaces or UI components. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies.[4][5][6] React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications. However, React is only concerned with state management and rendering that state to the DOM, so creating React applications usually requires the use of additional libraries for routing, as well as certain client-side functionality.[7]Components
        React code is made of entities called components. Components can be rendered to a particular element in the DOM using the React DOM library. When rendering a component, one can pass in values that are known as "props":[8]
        
        ReactDOM.render(<Greeter greeting="Hello World!" />, document.getElementById('myReactApp'));
        The two primary ways of declaring components in React is via function components and class-based components.
        
        Function components
        Function components are declared with a function that then returns some JSX.
        
        const Greeter = (props) => <div>Hello, {props.name}!</div>;
        Class-based components
        Class-based components are declared using ES6 classes.
        
        class ParentComponent extends React.Component {
          state = { color: 'green' };
          render() {
            return (
              <ChildComponent color={this.state.color} />
            );
          }
        }
        Virtual DOM
        Another notable feature is the use of a virtual Document Object Model, or virtual DOM. React creates an in-memory data-structure cache, computes the resulting differences, and then updates the browser's displayed DOM efficiently.[9] This process is called reconciliation. This allows the programmer to write code as if the entire page is rendered on each change, while the React libraries only render subcomponents that actually change. This selective rendering provides a major performance boost.[citation needed] It saves the effort of recalculating the CSS style, layout for the page and rendering for the entire page.[citation needed]
        
        Lifecycle methods
        Lifecycle methods use a form of hooking that allows the execution of code at set points during a component's lifetime.
        
        shouldComponentUpdate allows the developer to prevent unnecessary re-rendering of a component by returning false if a render is not required.
        componentDidMount is called once the component has "mounted" (the component has been created in the user interface, often by associating it with a DOM node). This is commonly used to trigger data loading from a remote source via an API.
        componentWillUnmount is called immediately before the component is torn down or "unmounted". This is commonly used to clear resource-demanding dependencies to the component that will not simply be removed with the unmounting of the component (e.g., removing any setInterval() instances that are related to the component, or an "eventListener" set on the "document" because of the presence of the component)
        render is the most important lifecycle method and the only required one in any component. It is usually called every time the component's state is updated, which should be reflected in the user interface.
        JSX
        Main article: JSX
        JSX, or JavaScript XML, is an extension to the JavaScript language syntax.[10] Similar in appearance to HTML, JSX provides a way to structure component rendering using syntax familiar to many developers. React components are typically written using JSX, although they do not have to be (components may also be written in pure JavaScript). JSX is similar to another extension syntax created by Facebook for PHP called XHP.
        
        An example of JSX code:
        
        class App extends React.Component {
          render() {
            return (
              <div>
                <p>Header</p>
                <p>Content</p>
                <p>Footer</p>
              </div>
            );
          }
        }
    </div>

    <div id="vue">
        <h1>Vue</h1>
        Vue.js (commonly referred to as Vue; pronounced /vjuː/, like "view"[4]) is an open-source model–view–viewmodel front end JavaScript framework for building user interfaces and single-page applications.[11] It was created by Evan You, and is maintained by him and the rest of the active core team members.[12]Vue features a reactivity system that uses plain JavaScript objects and optimized re-rendering. Each component keeps track of its reactive dependencies during its render, so the system knows precisely when to re-render, and which components to re-render.[38]

        Transitions
        Vue provides a variety of ways to apply transition effects when items are inserted, updated, or removed from the DOM. This includes tools to:
        
        Automatically apply classes for CSS transitions and animations
        Integrate third-party CSS animation libraries, such as Animate.css
        Use JavaScript to directly manipulate the DOM during transition hooks
        Integrate third-party JavaScript animation libraries, such as Velocity.js
        When an element wrapped in a transition component is inserted or removed, this is what happens:
        
        Vue will automatically sniff whether the target element has CSS transitions or animations applied. If it does, CSS transition classes will be added/removed at appropriate timings.
        If the transition component provided JavaScript hooks, these hooks will be called at appropriate timings.
        If no CSS transitions/animations are detected and no JavaScript hooks are provided, the DOM operations for insertion and/or removal will be executed immediately on next frame.[39][40]
        Routing
        A traditional disadvantage of single-page applications (SPAs) is the inability to share links to the exact "sub" page within a specific web page. Because SPAs serve their users only one URL-based response from the server (it typically serves index.html or index.vue), bookmarking certain screens or sharing links to specific sections is normally difficult if not impossible. To solve this problem, many client-side routers delimit their dynamic URLs with a "hashbang" (#!), e.g. page.com/#!/. However, with HTML5 most modern browsers support routing without hashbangs.
        
        Vue provides an interface to change what is displayed on the page based on the current URL path – regardless of how it was changed (whether by emailed link, refresh, or in-page links). Additionally, using a front-end router allows for the intentional transition of the browser path when certain browser events (i.e. clicks) occur on buttons or links. Vue itself doesn’t come with front-end hashed routing. But the open source "vue-router" package provides an API to update the application's URL, supports the back button (navigating history), and email password resets or email verification links with authentication URL parameters. It supports mapping nested routes to nested components and offers fine-grained transition control. With Vue, developers are already composing applications with small building blocks building larger components. With vue-router added to the mix, components must merely be mapped to the routes they belong to
